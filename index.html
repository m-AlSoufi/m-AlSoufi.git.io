            <p>
              Developed a virtual pet app that allows a user to interact with
              several pet objects through a menu of selections using Java code.

            <h3>Virtual Pet Shelter Console Application</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a virtual pet shelter app that housed several Java pet
              objects. The app offers several ways that a user can interact with
              the pets by feeding them, watering them or playing with them. The
              app relies on a pet map java method that allows the user to adopt
              a pet(remove it from the map) or admit a pet(add it to the map).
              The user can control the level of boredom of a single pet a time y
              selecting it for play

              pets.
