            <h3>Virtual Pet Console Application</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a virtual pet app that allows a user to interact with
              several pet objects through a menu of selections using Java code.
              The user must keep an eye on several pet objects stats like
              hunger, boredom and health. The stats change as time goes by and
              the user must fix through selecting to feed, water, or take the
              pets to the vet.

            <h3>Virtual Pet Shelter Console Application</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a virtual pet shelter app that housed several Java pet
              objects. The app offers several ways that a user can interact with
              the pets by feeding them, watering them or playing with them. The
              app relies on a pet map java method that allows the user to adopt
              a pet(remove it from the map) or admit a pet(add it to the map).
              The user can control the level of boredom of a single pet a time y
              selecting it for play

            <h3>Virtual Pet Amok Console Application</h3>
            <p>
              This java application uses inheritance and polymorphism to contain
              several kinds of pet that had different needs including robotic
              pets.
